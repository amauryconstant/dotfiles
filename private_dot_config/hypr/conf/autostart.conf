# Autostart Applications
# ============================================================================
# Applications and services to launch when Hyprland starts.
#
# DIRECTIVES:
# - exec-once  : Run once at startup (won't run again on config reload)
# - exec       : Run every time config is reloaded (use sparingly)
#
# WHEN TO USE exec-once:
# - Status bars, notification daemons, background services
# - Applications that should only have one instance
#
# WHEN TO USE exec:
# - Wallpaper setters that need to reapply on reload
# - One-time commands that are safe to run multiple times
