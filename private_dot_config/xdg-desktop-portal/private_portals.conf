# Hyprland-native first; gtk as the general-purpose fallback.
# kde.portal has UseIn=KDE so it should NOT be the default fallback in
# a Hyprland session — it fails Background and other queries outside KDE.
# xdg-desktop-portal-gtk covers: Background, Notification, OpenURI,
# Email, Print, Account, AppChooser, Inhibit, Wallpaper, Settings, …
default=hyprland;gtk
# KDE portal for file picker only — provides superior native dialog.
# Settings=kde removed: xdg-desktop-portal-kde is not installed; routing Settings
# to a missing backend creates unreliable fallback. GTK4 uses GDK_DEBUG=no-portals
# anyway, so libadwaita reads color-scheme via its own direct portal connection.
