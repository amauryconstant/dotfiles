## Cross-Platform Development Patterns

### **Pattern: Explicit Platform Detection**
- Always use explicit platform/distribution checks rather than feature detection when platform-specific code is necessary.
- Use built-in detection mechanisms (e.g., `.chezmoi.osRelease.id`) rather than custom detection scripts.
- Structure conditional blocks with the most specific conditions first, followed by more general fallbacks.
- *Rationale:* Explicit checks are more reliable and maintainable than implicit feature detection, which can lead to false positives and unexpected behavior.

### **Pattern: Modular Component Design**
- Break platform-specific functionality into modular components with clear interfaces.
- Separate common functionality from platform-specific implementations.
- Use factory patterns to create appropriate implementations based on the detected platform.
- *Rationale:* Modularity improves maintainability, makes testing easier, and allows for extending support to new platforms without affecting existing code.

### **Pattern: Graceful Degradation**
- Always provide fallback mechanisms when platform-specific features are unavailable.
- Implement progressive enhancement where possible, starting with basic functionality that works everywhere.
- Design systems to work with minimal functionality even when optimal features aren't available.
- *Rationale:* This ensures a baseline experience across all platforms while taking advantage of platform-specific features when available.

### **Pattern: Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Provide clear, actionable error messages when a platform is not supported.
- Include specific information about what went wrong and why.
- Offer guidance on manual alternatives or workarounds.
- *Rationale:* Good error messages improve user experience and reduce support burden by helping users solve problems themselves.

## Configuration Management Strategies

### **Pattern: Strategy-Based Package Management**
- Use the Strategy pattern to select different installation methods based on package type and availability.
- Define fallback strategies when primary methods fail.
- Abstract package management operations behind a consistent interface.
- *Rationale:* This approach balances stability (official repos) with availability (alternative sources) and provides consistent behavior across platforms.

### **Pattern: Templated Configuration with Platform Conditionals**
- Use templates with conditional logic to generate platform-specific configurations.
- Centralize platform detection and decision-making.
- Keep platform-specific variations in the template rather than creating separate files.
- *Rationale:* This maintains a single source of truth while accommodating platform differences, reducing duplication and potential inconsistencies.

### **Pattern: Strict File Naming Conventions**
- Implement clear naming conventions that communicate file purpose and handling.
- Use prefixes and suffixes to indicate special handling requirements.
- Follow consistent patterns across the project.
- *Rationale:* Clear naming enables automated processing, improves organization, and makes the system more maintainable.

## Security Best Practices

### **Pattern: Encryption Boundary Enforcement**
- Establish clear boundaries around encrypted content.
- Never attempt programmatic decryption of sensitive data.
- Guide users through manual workflows for handling encrypted content.
- *Rationale:* This approach protects sensitive information by ensuring encryption decisions are explicit and under user control.

### **Pattern: Documentation-Driven Security**
- Document security protocols clearly and comprehensively.
- Include verification checklists for security-critical operations.
- Provide clear guidance on handling sensitive data.
- *Rationale:* Security depends on consistent application of protocols, which requires clear documentation and understanding.

## Documentation Techniques

### **Pattern: In-Code Documentation for Platform-Specific Behavior**
- Include comprehensive documentation in code to explain platform-specific behavior.
- Document the rationale behind platform-specific decisions.
- Explain alternatives considered and why they were rejected.
- *Rationale:* This helps maintainers understand why certain approaches were taken and makes it easier to adapt the code for new platforms.

### **Pattern: Structured Project Documentation**
- Organize documentation in a clear hierarchy (project brief, product context, system patterns, etc.).
- Use consistent formatting and structure across documentation files.
- Include diagrams to visualize complex relationships and workflows.
- *Rationale:* Well-structured documentation is easier to navigate, understand, and maintain, improving project sustainability.

## Testing and Validation

### **Pattern: Platform-Specific Testing Strategy**
- Test on each supported platform individually.
- Create platform-specific test cases for platform-specific features.
- Use virtual machines or containers to simulate different environments.
- *Rationale:* Different platforms may have subtle differences that only appear during testing on that specific platform.

### **Pattern: Incremental Validation**
- Validate changes incrementally rather than all at once.
- Test each component in isolation before testing the integrated system.
- Use dry-run capabilities to preview changes before applying them.
- *Rationale:* Incremental validation makes it easier to identify and fix issues by limiting the scope of each test.

## Destination-Based Installation Patterns

### **Pattern: User-Centric Installation Profiles**
- Design installation profiles based on user intent rather than technical categories.
- Create clear, meaningful destination names that communicate purpose (test/work/leisure).
- Map technical components to user-focused destinations rather than exposing technical complexity.
- *Rationale:* Users think in terms of what they want to accomplish, not technical package categories. This improves user experience and reduces decision fatigue.

### **Pattern: Conditional Component Installation**
- Implement filtering logic that respects both destination requirements and dependency availability.
- Check for tool availability before attempting to configure it (e.g., VSCode extensions only if VSCode is installed).
- Provide clear feedback about what's being installed, skipped, and why.
- *Rationale:* This prevents installation failures and provides a better user experience by adapting to the actual system state.

### **Pattern: Template-Driven Configuration Filtering**
- Use template conditionals to filter components at the source rather than post-processing.
- Centralize destination logic in data files rather than scattering it across scripts.
- Leverage template engines' conditional capabilities for clean, readable filtering logic.
- *Rationale:* Template-driven filtering is more maintainable and provides better separation of concerns between data and logic.

### **Pattern: Backward-Compatible Feature Addition**
- Add new features (like destination filtering) as an additional layer rather than replacing existing functionality.
- Maintain existing APIs and patterns while extending them with new capabilities.
- Use feature flags or conditional logic to enable new behavior without breaking existing workflows.
- *Rationale:* This allows for gradual migration and reduces the risk of breaking existing functionality when adding new features.

## Data Structure Design for Configuration Management

### **Pattern: Hierarchical Configuration Data**
- Structure configuration data hierarchically to support different levels of specificity.
- Use consistent naming conventions that work with template engines (avoid hyphens in YAML keys).
- Design data structures that are both human-readable and machine-processable.
- *Rationale:* Well-structured data is easier to maintain, extend, and process programmatically while remaining understandable to humans.

### **Pattern: Self-Documenting Configuration**
- Include comprehensive comments in configuration files that explain purpose and usage.
- Use descriptive names for configuration keys and values.
- Document the relationship between different configuration sections.
- *Rationale:* Self-documenting configuration reduces the need for external documentation and makes the system more maintainable.

## Template Engine Best Practices

### **Pattern: Robust Template Error Handling**
- Validate template variables before use to prevent runtime errors.
- Provide meaningful error messages when template processing fails.
- Use template conditionals to handle missing or invalid data gracefully.
- *Rationale:* Template errors can be difficult to debug, so robust error handling improves the development and user experience.

### **Pattern: Template Logic Separation**
- Keep complex logic in data files rather than embedding it in templates.
- Use templates for presentation and simple conditionals, not complex business logic.
- Prefer data-driven configuration over template-driven computation.
- *Rationale:* This separation makes templates more readable and maintainable while keeping complex logic in more appropriate locations.
