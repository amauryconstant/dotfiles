# Script: .template-merge-driver.sh  
# Purpose: Custom git merge driver for .tmpl files that preserves template syntax
# Requirements: Arch Linux, git
# Usage: Called by git during merge operations on .tmpl files
# Args: %O (ancestor) %A (current) %B (other) %L (conflict-marker-size) %P (pathname)
